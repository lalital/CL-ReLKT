## Motivation
Cross-Lingual Retrieval Question Answering (CL-ReQA) is concerned with retrieving answer documents or passages to a question written in a different language. A common approach to CL-ReQA is to create a multilingual sentence embedding space such that question-answer pairs across different languages are close to each other. 

In this paper, our goal is to improve the robustness of multilingual sentence embedding that works with a wide range of languages, including those with a limited amount of training data. Leveraging the generalizability of knowledge distillation, we propose a Cross-Lingual Retrieval Language Knowledge Transfer} (CL-ReLKT) framework.
